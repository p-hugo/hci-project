# Song DB School and Church Project

This repo hosts the build code for a React application I'm currently developing for my church and also as a school project.

To run this code you need NodeJS installed or you can opt for an apache serving option

**Option 1: I have node already**

- Install the dependencies by running:
`npm install`

- Start the app:
`npm start`

**Option 2: Serving files with apache**

Simply move all the files under the `buil/` directory to your **sites** directory. 
You might have configured this previously or not but this directory is usually found under `/var/www/html` on linux systems.
